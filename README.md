## 📌 Problem Statement

People often consume news from a single source or region, leading to biased or narrow viewpoints. There's a need for a tool that:

- 📥 Compiles diverse news perspectives  
- 🌍 Highlights global public opinion  
- 📰 Shows how a single topic is reported differently in different cultures  

---

## 💡 Our Idea

Build a platform that:

- Shows **news headlines** on the same topic from multiple countries  
- Displays **public opinion and sentiment** from each region  
- Offers a "**Rewrite in Neutral Tone**" option to eliminate bias  
- Allows users to **submit their own voice and perspective**  
- Brings everything to life with an **immersive UI and animations**  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
- Vanilla JS (no frameworks)
- Fully responsive design
- Modern hover effects & custom cursor
