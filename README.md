An interactive web app that lets users explore how the \*\*same news topic is perceived differently around the world\*\*. Designed to encourage critical thinking, media literacy, and a broader understanding of global narratives.

                                                                  📌 Problem Statement

People often consume news from a single source or region, leading to biased or narrow viewpoints. There's a need for a tool that:
Compiles diverse news perspectives
Highlights global public opinion
Shows how a single topic is reported differently in different cultures

                                                                      💡 Our Idea

Create a platform that:

Shows news headlines on the same topic from multiple countries

Displays public opinion and sentiment from each region

Offers a Rewrite in Neutral Tone option to eliminate bias

Allows users to submit their own voice and perspective

Brings this to life with an immersive UI and visuals
